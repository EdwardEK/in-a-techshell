# In a TechShell 

## Shopify E-Commerce Store 
Launched independent online tech store through Shopify selling accessories, gadgets, and novelties.

## Main objective 
I find the world of e-commerce fascinating as it is ever growing and developing. I wanted to create a store and get my "feet wet" so to speak. My main objective was finding a niche and the process of implementing it. Even though the market is saturated within the tech niche, I still wanted to go that route because technology has always been a passion of mine. 

## Workflow / Process 
Research on trending products, types of business models, costs, various platforms and services, competitive analysis, compare and contrast suppliers and services provided, design, marketing and advertising objectives, deploy, and actively repeating the process. 

## Overview 
Extensive research and planning to build a solid and achievable workflow model starting with 
finding niche products that are in high demand through Google Trends, Amazon Wishlistâ€™s, 
and trending on social media. 

Developing relationships with suppliers and testing/ reviewing products based on various 
overall factors including shipping times and rates, package and product quality, customer 
service, and return policies.

Active financial report in Excel between margin cost and profit, services provided,             
monthly subscriptions, and domain access. 

Created engaging content with mission statement, product descriptions, selling points, 
images, custom logo, safe/secure payment options, social media, and a clean design for customer trust.
